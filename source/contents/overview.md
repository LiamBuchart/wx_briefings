#### Welcome to Weather Briefing Resource Site

This is a starting point for a weather briefing of any type. The page is organized into 4 main tabs:

- Observations
- Forecast Models
- Climatology
- Blogs/Interpretation

The tabs contain useful links for accessing data and recourses to construct a forecast. I do my best to provide some context for the websites that I frequently use.

In order to best make use of these weather briefing resources ensure that you are following the Forecast Funnel (`https://www.weather.gov/rah/virtualtourforecast`). Ensure that you ground yourself in the large scale weather patterns, see what process are driving your current weather. From here you can move slowly down to finer scales and see what mesoscale and microscale processes are influencing you local weather. 

The goal of these resources are to provide the user with enough resources to give a variety briefings, ranging from the national scale to a point forecast at a specific location.

If you have any suggestions for new sites to add or if you notice a link is outdates/no longer exits please do not hesitate to reach out to:
