> A huge amount of model output from Environment and Climate Change Canada. Can select any Candian model and a near infinite choise of output and variables. Zoomable interface over all of Canada, can save image and gifs as needed. Animet also includes a huge selection of MSc observations including radar and satellite.

### Windy
> > [Windy](https://www.windy.com/-Menu/menu?500h,54.835,-103.298,3,i:gh,m:eZyaeym)

> One of the more unique forecast pages. A variety of weather variables that can be adjusted for height. Users can also add plugins, the most useful of which is the is the MeteoBlue plugin. These are some of the best meteograms available.

-----------

### Tropical Tidbits
> > [Forecast Models](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/)

> Southern US focued weather page. Focused information on the Atlantic Basin hurricanes. Really good satellite imagery for the tropics. Additionally, a wide range of models including deterministic and probabilisitic models. Additionally can look at short term seasonal forecast on a national scale. The only good zoom over Canada is nationwide.

### Pivotal Weather

> > [Pivotal](https://www.pivotalweather.com/model.php?m=cmceens&p=qpf_acc-mean-met&rh=2025062512&fh=384&r=na&dpdt=&mc=)

> A wide range of model output for a variety of application. Pivotal has create resources for convective forecasting and winter weather. 

-----------

### Climate Prediction Center Madden Julian Oscillation Forecast

> > [CPC MJO](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/MJO/CLIVAR/clivar_wh.shtml)

> Model viewer for the forecast MJO index which goes out ~2 weeks. 

-----------

### UBC WFRT Vancouver Forecast

> > [WFRT](https://weather.eos.ubc.ca/wxfcst/users/Guest/ubcrs_withicons/index.php?location=3510)

> The best meteorgram for Vancouver that there is. 

-----------

### BlueSky - Smoke
> > [FireSmoke](https://firesmoke.ca/)

> Access surface smoke modeling as well as an FWI forecast. Additionally, BlueSky Playground is available to run different emissions scenarios for prescribed fires. 

-----------

### North American Pollution Center
> > [NA RVFSP-WAC](https://hpfx.collab.science.gc.ca/~svfs000/na-vfsp-was/public/dist/smoke-forecasting/individual-models)

> Multi-model viewer for PM2.5 and other smoke related variables. Also a link for CWFIS fire weather maps and subseasonal outlook maps.

-----------

### National Forest Service Hot Dry Windy

> > [HWD](https://hdwindex.fs2c.usda.gov/)

> Canada/USA Hot Dry Windy index map. Can pull timeseries of the HDW index including climatological means. Links to prominent HDW publications and how to interpret the index. 

-----------

### Windgrams

> > [RASP Windgrams](https://www.canadarasp.com/windgrams/?region=9&location=0&plotType=1)

> Using Canadian data to create a visual meteogram for different locations in western Canada. Looks specifically at surface pressure, total cloud, and atmospheric stability. Gives a great look at how stability changes diurnally under different weather patters. Only produces at certain locations in western Canada.
