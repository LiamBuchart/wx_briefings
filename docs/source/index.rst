Weather Briefing Documentation
==========================

Useful resources for constructing your next weather briefing. This is a starting point for a weather briefing of any type. 
The page is organized into 4 main tabs:

- Observations
- Forecast Models
- Climatology
- Blogs/Interpretation

The tabs contain useful links for accessing data and resources to construct a forecast. I do my best to provide some context for the websites that I frequently use.

In order to best make use of these weather briefing resources ensure that you are following the Forecast Funnel (`https://www.weather.gov/rah/virtualtourforecast`). Start by grounding yourself in the large scale weather patterns, see what process are driving your current weather. From here you can move slowly down to finer scales and see what mesoscale and microscale processes are influencing you local weather.

The goal of these tabs and pages is to provide the user with enough resources to give a variety briefings, ranging from the national scale to a point forecast at a specific location.
