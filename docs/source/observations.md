# Observations

Start here before getting into any model data or forecast interpretation. Ground your forecast in observations and the current state of the atmosphere. I have also opted to include agency analyses as observations.

===========

### ECCC Analyses

> > [ECCC Analysis](https://weather.gc.ca/analysis/index_e.html)

> Hemispheric overview of upper air patterns (only current maps). Four times daily surface maps including fronts. 

-----------

### College of DuPage Satellite & Radar

> > [College of DuPage](https://weather.cod.edu/#)

> The best publicly available satellite produce. Localized domains over much of southern Canada. Great RGB products. Radar only covers extreme southern Canada.

### ECCC Satellite & Radar

>> [Radar](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/radar-satellites.html)

> The satellite images on this page are not overly useful. Suprisingly good radar imagery. Radar is interactive and lightning can be overlaid as well as Environment Canada weather alerts. 

-----------

### Mesonet Portal 

> > [Western MesoNet](https://meso.cssl.ca/)

> Put on by Western University. One of the highest densities of Canadian observations. Goes back 24hrs. and can be animated. Zoom and click on an observation to get the previous day's data.

-----------

### University of Wyoming Sounding Archive

> > [UW Soundings](https://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding.shtml)

> Archived global soundings. The best resource to quickly look at tephis for anywhere in the world. They also have an easy to use API to grab .csv files of observations. A daily file can be easily modified to initialize a WRF-LES run. 

-----------

### Blitzortung Lightning

> > [Blitzortung](https://map.blitzortung.org/#4.01/58.48/-100.29)

> Live global lightning observations. Can animate back 2 hours. 

-----------

### Canadian Drought Monitor

> > [Canadian Drought Monitor](https://agriculture.canada.ca/en/agricultural-production/weather/canadian-drought-monitor)

>Look at the current drought conditions as well as compare current conditions to historical. They also have a nice tool to view the monthly precipitaiton and temperatures in terms of historical averages - focused on the growing regions in Canada. 

-----------

### Daily CPC Madden Julian Oscillation

> > [CPC MJO](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/MJO/whindex.shtml)

> Daily MJO index for the previous 40 and 90 days. Can also access archived MJO indices back to 1981.
