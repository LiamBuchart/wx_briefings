# Observations

Start here before getting into any model data or forecast interpretation. Ground your forecast in observations and the current state of the atmosphere. I have also opted to include agency analyses as observations.

### ECCC Analyses
>> [ECCC Analysis](https://weather.gc.ca/analysis/index_e.html)
> Hemispheric overview of upper air patterns (only current maps). Four times daily surface maps including fronts. 

### College of DuPage Satellite & Radar
>> [College of DuPage](https://weather.cod.edu/#)
> The best publicly available satellite produce. Localized domains over much of southern Canada. Radar only covers extreme southern Canada. 

### ECCC Satellite & Radar
>> [Radar](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/radar-satellites.html)
> The satellite images on this page are not overly useful. Suprisingly good radar imagery. Radar is interactive and lightning can be overlaid as well as Environment Canada weather alerts. 

### Mesonet Portal 
>> [Western MesoNet](https://meso.cssl.ca/)
> Put on by Western University. One of the highest densities of Canadian observations. Goes back 24hrs. and can be animated. Zoom and click on an observation

### Canadian Drought Monitor
>> [Canadian Drought Monitor](https://agriculture.canada.ca/en/agricultural-production/weather/canadian-drought-monitor)
>Look at the current drought conditions as well as compare current conditions to historical. They also have a nice tool to view the monthly precipitaiton and temperatures in terms of historical averages - focused on the growing regions in Canada.
