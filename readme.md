wx_briefings:

This is a starting point to grab observations, model data, and read prominent weather blogs to generate simple weather briefings and forecasts.

Organization will be structured based on 4 tabs:
- Observations
- Model Data
- Blogs and Interpretation
- Artifical Intelligence

Click on each tab to access links to related tools. I try to provide a brief description of what the website offeres if I have used them significantly.
